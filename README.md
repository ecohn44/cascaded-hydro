This repository builds a optimization-based simulation for the lower Columbia River.   
*nonlinear-det-sim.jl* is the original nonlinear formulation under deterministic conditions.   
*convexhull-det-sim.jl* is the application of a 2D convex hull approximation that linearizes the original formulation.
